	   <h2>About Me</h2>
	<!-- Tell a little bit about myself --> 
            <p> I am a current student at <a href='https://www.thinkful.com/'>Thinkful</a> and I am currently working full time for <a href='https://www.coscofire.com/'>Cosco Fire Protection</a>. I grew up in Alaska and moved down to California around four years ago, I am currently in the process of learning web development and I have been enjoying every minute of it. This has brought a new love to creation that I did not know that I had, I am looking forward to what I will be able to create by the end of my school.</p>
